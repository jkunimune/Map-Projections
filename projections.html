<p>Here I have a list of all of my projections with descriptions and examples.</p>
<p><h2 style="color:Gray">Equirectangular</h2>A simple linear mapping of latitude vs longitude.</p>
<img src="images/equirectangular.jpg" alt="Sorry. This image is not here at the moment. Please leave a message after the beep." title="Boring! It's not even a real projection.">
<p><h2 style="color:Gray">Mercator</h2>An extremely common shape-preserving cylindrical map.</p>
<img src="images/mercator.jpg" alt="Sorry. This image is not here at the moment. Please leave a message after the beep." title="It's only popular because it Mer-caters to the largest demographic.">
<p><h2 style="color:Gray">Gall Stereographic</h2>A compromising cylindrical map.</p>
<img src="images/gall.jpg" alt="Sorry. This image is not here at the moment. Please leave a message after the beep." title="A compromise projection? How galling.">
<p><h2 style="color:Gray">Cyllindrical Equal-Area</h2>An equal-area cylindrical projection.</p>
<img src="images/hobo-dyer.jpg" alt="Sorry. This image is not here at the moment. Please leave a message after the beep." title="What's that? You think I don't like the Peters map because I'm uncomfortable with having my cultural assumptions challenged? Are you sure you're not... ::puts on sunglasses:: ...projecting?">
<p><h2 style="color:Gray">Polar</h2>An equidistant azimuthal projection.</p>
<img src="images/polar.jpg" alt="Sorry. This image is not here at the moment. Please leave a message after the beep." title="Of course, this is what the earth actually looks like; that whole sphere nonsense is just a conspiracy.">
<p><h2 style="color:Gray">Stereographic</h2>A shape-preserving azimuthal map.</p>
<img src="images/stereographic.jpg" alt="Sorry. This image is not here at the moment. Please leave a message after the beep." title="Stereo: Two. Graph: Picture. Stereo+Graphic: an azimuthal conformal map projection. Logic.">
<p><h2 style="color:Gray">Azimuthal Equal-Area</h2>An equal-area azimuthal projection.</p>
<img src="images/az-eq-ar.jpg" alt="Sorry. This image is not here at the moment. Please leave a message after the beep." title="Yet another map projection named after Johann Heinrich Lambert.">
<p><h2 style="color:Gray">Orthographic</h2>A realistic rendering of the Earth viewed from a great distance.</p>
<img src="images/orthographic.jpg" alt="Sorry. This image is not here at the moment. Please leave a message after the beep." title="Orthographic? More like Orthogonal! <ba-dum, crash>">
<p><h2 style="color:Gray">Gnomonic</h2>A projection where all great circles are straight lines.</p>
<img src="images/gnomonic.jpg" alt="Sorry. This image is not here at the moment. Please leave a message after the beep." title="Gnomonic? More like Gnomic! <ba-dum crash>">
<p><h2 style="color:Gray">Winkel Tripel</h2>A compromise projection used by National Geographic (not currently functional).</p>
<img src="images/winkel-tripel.jpg" alt="Sorry. This image is not here at the moment. Please leave a message after the beep." title="'Not currently functional?' It looks fine to me.">
<p><h2 style="color:Gray">Van der Grinten</h2>A round map projection similar to Mercator.</p>
<img src="images/vandergrinten.jpg" alt="Sorry. This image is not here at the moment. Please leave a message after the beep." title="It's like Mercator, only worse!">
<p><h2 style="color:Gray">Mollweide</h2>An equal-area projection shaped like an ellipse.</p>
<img src="images/mollweide.jpg" alt="Sorry. This image is not here at the moment. Please leave a message after the beep." title="I like mollweide.">
<p><h2 style="color:Gray">Hammer</h2>Another equal-area projection shaped like an ellipse.</p>
<img src="images/hammer.jpg" alt="Sorry. This image is not here at the moment. Please leave a message after the beep." title="STOP!                                                                                                                              Hammer Time.">
<p><h2 style="color:Gray">Sinusoidal</h2>An equal-area projection shaped like a sinusoid.</p>
<img src="images/sinusoidal.jpg" alt="Sorry. This image is not here at the moment. Please leave a message after the beep." title="I'll sign your soil! Ha ha haha. Ha.">
<p><h2 style="color:Gray">Lemons</h2>The earth unfolded into a bunch of little lemon-shaped things.</p>
<img src="images/lemons.jpg" alt="Sorry. This cake is not true at the moment. Please leave a message after the beep." title="BURN LIFE'S HOUSE DOWN!">
<p><h2 style="color:Gray">Pierce Quincuncial</h2>A complex shape-preserving map shaped like a square.</p>
<img src="images/pierce.jpg" alt="Sorry. This image is not here at the moment. Please leave a message after the beep." title="Challenging pierceptions since 1879.">
<p><h2 style="color:Gray">Guyou Hemisphere-in-a-Square</h2>Pierce Quincuncial, but rearranged a little bit.</p>
<img src="images/guyou.jpg" alt="Sorry. This image is not here at the moment. Please leave a message after the beep." title="Challenging pierceptions since 1887.">
<p>
<h2 style="color:Gray">AuthaGraph</h2> 
A nearly-equal-area tetrahedral projection.
<img src="images/authagraph.jpg" alt="Sorry. This image is not here at the moment. Please leave a message after the beep." title="Not to be confused with authagraphic projections, which is the cool kid map projection club that this one wishes it could be in.">
<h2 style="color:Gray">Tetragraph</h2> 
A compromising tetrahedral projection that I invented after being inspired by the AuthaGraph.
<img src="images/tetragraph.jpg" alt="BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP." title="Yeah, I invented this one. It's a linear mapping from Justesian coordinates to cartolar coordinates.">
