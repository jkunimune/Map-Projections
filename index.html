          <p>Map Projections is a repository designed to create oblique map projections. Simply extract the zip file, run the MapDesigner.jar executable from it's place in the folder, and create your own map in seconds! There are thousands of combinations of color-schemes, projections, and aspects. Includes Mercator, Mollweide, Orthographic, Peirce-Quincuncial, and more!</p>
          <p>Here are just a few images/examples of what you can create with Map Projections.</p>

          <center>
            <p><img src="images/example0.gif" width="75%" alt="Uh oh, the map is missing. I promise, it looks really good." title="Oblique Mercator with Tissot's Indicatrices. Oh yes, those are all real words."></p>
            <p><img src="images/example2.gif" width="75%" alt="Uh oh, the map is missing. I promise, it looks really good." title="Oblique Gnomonic Projection Centered on Jerusalem. It's supposed to be like a modern T-and-O map. Look it up. Man, Europeans were pretentious."></p>
            <p><img src="images/example1.gif" width="75%" alt="Uh oh, the map is missing. I promise, it looks really good." title="Oblique Azimuthal Equal-Area Projection of Altitude. The center is actually the pyramids of Giza, because that's where the Internet told me to put it."></p>
            <p><img src="images/example5.gif" width="75%" alt="Uh oh, the map is missing. I promise, it looks really good." title="Rendering of Earth with Random Orientation. Okay, fine, 'pseudorandom'."></p>
            <p><img src="images/example3.gif" width="75%" alt="Uh oh, the map is missing. I promise, it looks really good." title="Oblique Lee Tetrahedral Projection Arranged into a Rectangle. I'll be honest, Western Europe, by coincidence, ended up hitting a lot of the dilation of this projection. In my defense, Western Africa is also rather inflated."></p>
            <p><img src="images/example4.gif" width="75%" alt="Uh oh, the map is missing. I promise, it looks really good." title="Oblique Tobler Hyperelliptic Projection with Countries Shaded. Iatshuip pi Gall Peters id! Also, notice how I only used four colors."></p>
            <p><img src="images/example6.gif" width="75%" alt="Uh oh, the map is missing. I promise, it looks really good." title="Oblique Black and White Lemons Projection. This projection doesn't have a real name that I could find, though I suppose 'Interrupted Cassini' might be more appropriate. I really like calling it 'Lemons', though."></p>
